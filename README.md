Initially created by Dummiesman, updated by me to make it work with Blender 3.0 *(tested with 2021-12-02 18:35, f1cca3055776)*

IT ONLY IMPORTS DIFFUSE TEXTURE, ADDITIONAL TEXTURES YOU HAVE TO ADD MANUALLY

> 1.Requirements
>  The addon was created in Blender 2.77. If you have any issues with the addon in a previous Blender version, I will NOT provide support!!
>
> 2.Installation
>  Blender 32 Bit:
>    On 32 bit Blender installations, extract the downloaded ZIP file to
>    C:\Program Files (x86)\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.77\scripts\addon
>
>  Blender 64 Bit:
>    On 64 bit Blender installations, extract the downloaded ZIP file to
>    C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.77\scripts\addons
>
>  After you extract the Add-on, it will NOT show up in your import/export list by default!
>
>  After extracting the Add-on, start Blender. Once Blender is started, open up File->User Preferences, and navigate over to the Add-ons tab. Find the add-on or search "NinjaRipper", and enable it. Click "Save User Preferences" on the bottom of the dialog, and close the dialog.

>  Now you will be able to use the Add-on.

> 3.Importing
>  Textures
>    Based on the logic in the vanilla 3dsmax script, this add-on will attempt to import textures
